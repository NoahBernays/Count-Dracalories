# Count-Dracalories
Group: OOPs, I did it again

327 Android app: BU calorie counter

All project documentation (ProjectTimeline.doc, ProjectDocumentation.doc, StatementOfWork.doc, and ProjectArchitecture.ppt) is contained within the Project_documentation folder.

Instructions on how to run project:
Make sure all code from the bucalcounter folder is in your working directory. We used SDK 23 and compiled our code on Eclipse. Run the program either using a virtual device or an Android phone connected by a USB cable.

Once the app is running, click on the Count Dracalories icon on the homepage. This brings you to the homepage. Once there, you can click on the information button in the bottom right corner to bring you to an information page outlining what the app does and who made it. From every page, you can click on the home icon in the top right corner to return to the home page, or the calendar icon in the top left corner to bring you to the calendar view. Once on the home page again, click on either "Enter Meal" to enter what food you ate, or on "Calendar" to see what you've eaten and how many calories you've consumed on any given day. After clicking "Enter Meal," you will be brought to a screen with four main buttons. If you are eating at a BU dining hall, click which meal is applicable. If you want to enter a food item and its calories manually, click "Enter Meal Manually." Say you click "Baystate" -- you will be brought to a page that has a dropdown menu of all the menu items at that dining hall for that meal. After choosing a food item either manually or at a BU dining hall, click "Save" to have the item and calorie information saved to the calendar.

Enjoy, and happy eating!
